//Open Issue: (Seeking input) there were two observations for Date of last menstral period, one with a code from LOINC and one with a code from SNOMED-CT. The Observation with the LOINC code was chosen over the SNOMED-CT, as best practice is to use LIONC for observation codes. 
//Open Issue: seeking Comment -- Menstral status observations have code values from SNOMED-CT. Proper practice with deffining observation is to use LOINC in the code section. Looking for comment to determine if the origional SNOMED code should be retained  or replaced with a LOINC code
